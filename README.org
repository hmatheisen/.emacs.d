* My GNU Emacs config

Most of the interesting code can be found in the =modules/=
directory.  It's arranged arbitrarily for now but I try to stay
consitent.

** TODOS

- [ ] re-arrange modules files
- [ ] generate release.md buffer (ask for source and target and fill a
  md file with git log's content)
- [ ] improve code navigation with lsp
- [ ] function to switch buffer between 2 windows
